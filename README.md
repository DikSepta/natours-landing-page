A landing page from  Natours, tour guide company. Built as a part of Udemy: [Advance CSS and SASS](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) course by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann).
This site is focused on styling techniques using SASS. Hence some functionality are not intentionally built. You can see the demo at my github pages [diksepta.github.io/natours-landing-page](https://diksepta.github.io/natours-landing-page/). But for full experience, please just download all code & resource then run it in your local.
